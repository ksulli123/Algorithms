# Algorithms
This project solves the N-Queens problem by using several algorithms. The hill climbing algorithm, random start HC, Annealing
and the genetic algorithm. In the N-queens problem a queen cannot be on the same line horizontally, vertically or diagonally, where N queens must be placed on a N by N sized board. This queen positions are generated randomly.
